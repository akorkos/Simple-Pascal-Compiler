# Compiler Design 101

This repository includes a compiler for the SimplePascal language assignement for the course [Programming Languages and Compilers [NCO-04-01]](https://elearning.auth.gr/course/view.php?id=8084) (2021/22) of the Department of Computer Science at Aristotle University of Thessaloniki.

## Description

The SimplePascal language resembles the high-level language PASCAL and is defined as follows. SimplePascal is structured with compound statements, which are a subset of the commands in classical PASCAL. Unlike classical PASCAL, SimplePascal does not include pointer types. The structure of subprograms is maintained in SimplePascal, allowing the definition of nested subprograms.

For more infomation about the lexical, syntax analysis and parsing, see [SimplePascal description **(GR)**](https://github.com/akorkos/Simple-Pascal/raw/master/Assignment_description.pdf).
